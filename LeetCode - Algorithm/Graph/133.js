I initially thought the time complexity would be O(n), but thatâ€™s not accurate. The time complexity is
actually O(n + e), where e represents the number of edges. When using a recursive approach, the number
of function calls is crucial. Although I used a hash map to avoid redundant computations and some function
calls return the node instantly, those calls still need to be considered in the overall time complexity.
